## 1. System Architecture & Capabilities

MacOSaiX Remake is engineered from the ground up for modern macOS (macOS 14 Sonoma, macOS 15 Sequoia, and newer) on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):

- **Zero UI Freezes**: Target subsampling, tile mask rasterization, and source image evaluation run asynchronously in detached background worker tasks (`Task.detached`), leaving the AppKit/SwiftUI runloop completely unhindered at 60–120 FPS.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Codecs**: Utilizes Apple's native `ImageIO` framework to read and export modern file formats including **AVIF**, **HEIC/HEIF** (with full hardware EXIF orientation handling), **WebP**, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP.
- **Safe Memory Architecture**: All 10-bit / HDR surfaces and color-managed images are normalized to contiguous 8-bit sRGB buffers before processing, preventing kernel faults or GPU out-of-memory crashes.
- **Progressive Live Assembly**: Watch tiles refine and update on the fly as better matching photos are discovered.

> [!NOTE]
> **Ad-Hoc Signing & First Launch on macOS**:

### Window Overview & Toolbar

- **Dock Icon & Window Drag-and-Drop**:
  - Drag any `.macosaix` project file onto the app icon in the macOS Dock or directly into the main window to open the project.
  - Drag any image file directly onto the canvas to set it as the basis target image.
- **Top Left**:
  - **Open Project (`⌘O`)**: Open a previously saved `.macosaix` project package.
  - **Save Project (`⌘S`)**: Save the current mosaic setup, source directories, and matched tiles.
  - **About (`ⓘ`)**: View version info, credits, and links.
- **Center**:
  - **Status Capsule**: Displays active solver status, match counts, and progress spinners.
- **Top Right**:
  - **Export (`⌘E`)**: Open high-resolution export dialog.
  - **Start / Pause (`⌘R`)**: Begin or pause candidate evaluation.
  - **Stop (`⌘.`)**: Finalize and stop matching.

### Step 1: Selecting a Target Image

Click **Choose Image...** in Section 1 of the sidebar, or **drag an image directly onto the mosaic canvas**, to select the image your photomosaic will recreate.

> [!TIP]
> High-contrast images with well-defined subjects (portraits, architecture, distinctive objects, vehicles, landscapes) produce the most visually stunning photomosaics. Images with large blown-out white areas or pitch-black voids benefit most from our **Adaptive Quadtree** mode.

### Step 2: Configuring Photo Sources

Add folders containing photos that will serve as the constituent tiles:
- Click **Add Folder...** or **drag and drop folders directly from Finder** into the source list.
- All subfolders are automatically scanned recursively.
- Both standard formats (JPEG, PNG) and mobile formats (HEIC from iPhones, AVIF, WebP) are fully supported.

> [!NOTE]
> A source collection of **500 to 5,000+ photos** offers optimal color variety. However, with **Reinhard OKLab Color Transfer**, even small collections of 50–100 photos can produce remarkable results.

### Step 3: Choosing Tile Shapes & Tessellations

Select from four distinct tessellation models:
1. **Rectangles / Squares**: Traditional uniform grid.
2. **Hexagons**: Modern honeycomb lattice.
3. **Jigsaw Puzzle**: Mathematically generated interlocking jigsaw pieces with Bezier tabs.
4. **Adaptive Quadtree**: Dynamic multi-resolution tiling that places small tiles in detailed regions and large tiles in smooth regions.

### Step 4: Color Matching & Perceptual Controls

- **Color Metric**:
  - *Riemersma (Perceptual)*: Human eye spectral sensitivity weighting.
  - *Euclidean (RGB)*: Mathematical RGB channel distance.
- **Max Reuse**:
  - Set to `1` for a strict "No Duplicates" fine-art mosaic where every photo is unique.
  - Set to `0` (or leave unchecked) for unlimited reuse.
- **Minimum Distance**:
  - Restricts identical photos from appearing within $N$ tiles of each other.
- **Reinhard OKLab Color Transfer**:
  - Adjust slider from `0%` (pure original photo colors) to `100%` (complete color match).
  - Recommended sweet spot: `30% – 50%`.
- **Edge-Aware Directional Matching**:
  - Aligns internal photo contours with the target image edges.
  - Recommended sweet spot: `25% – 45%`.

### Step 5: Solving, Pausing & Real-Time Navigation

- Click **Start** (`⌘R`) at the top right to begin matching.
- **2D Glide & Momentum**: Drag with two fingers on your trackpad to glide across the canvas with native macOS inertia.
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Pinch on the trackpad or hold `⌘` and scroll to zoom smoothly between `25%` and `400%`.
- **Compare Slider**: Drag the blend slider at the bottom of the canvas to seamlessly crossfade between the original target photo and the assembled mosaic.
- **Tile Inspection & Substitution**:
  - Click any tile on the preview canvas to open its detail inspector popover.
  - **Find Substitute (`arrow.triangle.2.circlepath`)**: Recomputes candidate scores for that specific tile across all source photos, excluding the current photo. Clicking it repeatedly cycles through the 2nd best, 3rd best, 4th best candidates, updating the canvas in real time.
  - **Choose Photo... (`photo.badge.plus`)**: Manually select any image from disk to place in this tile.
  - **Reveal in Finder (`folder`)**: Selects and highlights the original constituent image in Finder.

### Step 6: Saving Projects & High-Resolution Export

- **Saving (`⌘S`)**: Saves a lightweight `.macosaix` package containing image bookmarks, settings, and tile state.
- **Exporting (`⌘E`)**:
  - Choose output format: **PNG**, **JPEG**, **TIFF**, **HEIC**, or **AVIF**.
  - Choose resolution: `1×` (Preview), `2×` (Retina), `4×` (Ultra HD / Print), or specify custom pixel width up to 12,000+ pixels.
  - Toggle and customize border cutlines (width and color: black, white, or clear).

## 3. Adaptive Quadtree Segmentation (Deep Dive)

### The Quadtree Concept

Traditional photomosaics force an unpleasant compromise:
- **Small tiles** capture fine facial details (eyes, lips, eyelashes) but make individual photos tiny and unreadable.
- **Large tiles** showcase your photos beautifully, but destroy delicate contours into jagged pixel blocks.

**Adaptive Quadtree Segmentation** solves this by decomposing the canvas into a hierarchical tree: smooth areas remain large, while intricate features automatically subdivide into progressively smaller tiles.

### Algorithm 1: Whole Canvas Quadtree

- **How it works**: Begins with a single root cell covering the **entire image canvas** ($0, 0, W, H$).
- **Behavior**: Recursively tests whether the entire rectangle is sufficiently uniform. If not, it splits into 4 quadrants. This produces a dramatic macro-composition where massive tiles frame large sky or background areas, while focal subjects are rendered with dense, intricate tiles.
- **Balancing**: Integrated with 2:1 neighbor balancing to guarantee no harsh visual steps between adjacent tiles.

### Algorithm 2: Julia Extrema Range

Inspired by Julia's `ImageSegmentation.jl` / `RegionTrees.jl`:

$$\Delta_{\text{extrema}} = \max_{(x,y) \in R} Y(x,y) - \min_{(x,y) \in R} Y(x,y)$$

A quadrant is considered homogeneous and stops subdividing if:

$$\Delta_{\text{extrema}} < \text{threshold}$$

- **Why it excels**: Unlike variance, which averages pixel differences over the entire quadrant, the extrema range is ultra-sensitive to razor-thin high-contrast features: a single-pixel line, an eyelash, or a bright reflection will immediately trigger subdivision.
- **Smooth areas**: Smooth gradients (e.g. skin tones, soft shadows) have low extrema ranges and remain gracefully large.

### Algorithm 3: RGB Color Range

Computes the Chebyshev color divergence across all three color channels simultaneously:

$$\Delta_{\text{RGB}} = \max \left( \Delta R, \Delta G, \Delta B \right)$$

where:

$$\Delta C = \max_{(x,y) \in R} C(x,y) - \min_{(x,y) \in R} C(x,y)$$

- **Why it excels**: Catches chromatic transitions where luminance is identical but hue or saturation shifts sharply (e.g. a red flower on green foliage of equal perceived brightness).

### Algorithm 4: Variance / Hybrid

Uses Crow (1984) Summed-Area Tables (Integral Images) to compute statistical variance $\sigma_Y$ in $O(1)$ constant time (8 lookups per quadrant), combined with Sobel gradient edge density:

$$\text{Detail} = (1 - \alpha) \cdot \frac{\|\nabla Y\|}{M_{\max}} + \alpha \cdot \frac{\sigma_Y}{128.0}$$

- **Detail Modes**:
  - *Edge-Aware ($\alpha = 0.2$)*: Focuses subdivision strictly along sharp contours.
  - *Balanced ($\alpha = 0.5$)*: Equal balance of edges and surface texture.
  - *Texture-Sensitive ($\alpha = 0.8$)*: Subdivides on high-frequency noise and fine textures.

### Quadtree Control Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Grid** | 10×10 to 80×80 | Starting coarse grid before adaptive subdivision (ignored in Whole Canvas mode). |
| **Max Depth** | 1 to 5 levels | Maximum subdivision depth ($2^D$ factor, up to $32\times$ smaller than base tiles). |
| **Detail Sensitivity** | 0% to 100% | Sensitivity slider. Calibrated so 0% (far left, threshold `0.85`) preserves large base tiles, while 100% (far right, threshold `0.05`) isolates subtle nuances. |
| **Min Tile Size Floor** | 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 px | Absolute hardware floor preventing tiles from becoming microscopic unreadable specs. |
| **2:1 Balanced Transitions**| On / Off | Restricts neighbor depth differences to $\le 1$ level, creating smooth aesthetic transitions. |

## 4. Geometric Tile Shapes

### Interlocking Jigsaw Puzzles

Every puzzle piece is generated using parametric cubic Bezier curves:
- **Tabs & Sockets**: Neighboring pieces share identical control points inverted across the shared boundary, ensuring 100% mathematical interlocking without gaps.
- **Curviness Slider**: Modulates the waviness and tab displacement from `0.0` (classical straight-edged tabs) to `1.0` (wild, highly organic pieces).
- **Die-Cut Cutlines**: Optional vector outlines rendered at export with sub-pixel anti-aliasing to simulate physical cardboard puzzle die-cuts.

### Hexagonal Honeycombs

Tessellates the image using regular hexagonal geometry with staggered odd/even rows. Hexagons provide a modern, architectural appearance that softens the rigid rectangular grid of traditional mosaics.

### Classic Rectangles

The timeless photomosaic standard. Maximizes photo area and visual clarity without cropping corners.

---

## 5. Advanced Perceptual Color & Matching Science

### Riemersma Spectral Color Metric

Traditional Euclidean distance in RGB space fails because human vision has non-uniform spectral sensitivities (we are much more sensitive to subtle differences in green than in blue):

$$\Delta C = \sqrt{2 \Delta R^2 + 4 \Delta G^2 + 3 \Delta B^2 + \frac{\bar{R}(\Delta R^2 - \Delta B^2)}{256}}$$

MacOSaiX Remake uses this perceptual metric by default, producing mosaics that look naturally photographic rather than digitally synthesized.

### Reinhard Statistical Color Transfer in OKLab Space

When your source photos don't match the target image's color palette, traditional software applies a crude transparent color overlay. This washes out contrast and muddies details.

Instead, MacOSaiX Remake implements **Reinhard Color Transfer in the modern OKLab space**:
1. Candidate and target tile pixels are mapped to linear OKLab coordinates ($L, a, b$).
2. Mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) are computed per channel.
3. Candidate pixel values are normalized and shifted:
   $$c_{\text{trans}} = \mu_{\text{target}, c} + \left( \frac{\sigma_{\text{target}, c}}{\sigma_{\text{src}, c}} \right) \cdot (c_{\text{src}} - \mu_{\text{src}, c})$$
4. The user controls transfer strength via an interactive real-time slider ($0\%$ to $100\%$). Lightness ($L$) and chromatic channels ($a, b$) are shifted without flattening shadow details.

### Edge-Aware Directional Matching (Sobel HOG)

Extracts an 8-bin Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) from both the target tile and candidate photos. Photos whose internal line flow matches the target tile's edge direction receive a matching score bonus.

### Placement Constraints: Max Reuse & Min Distance

- **Max Reuse**: Restricts how many times any single source photo can appear in the mosaic. Setting this to `1` produces a 100% unique "No Duplicates" mosaic.
- **Min Distance**: Guarantees that duplicate photos are separated by at least $N$ tiles in Manhattan grid distance, preventing visual clustering.

### Pro Tips for Best Results

1. **Optimal Photo Library**: Aim for at least 500 diverse photos. When working with themed libraries (e.g. all black-and-white or all underwater photos), set **Color Transfer** to `40%–50%` to bridge color gaps naturally.
2. **Preventing Duplicates**: If your library has 3,000+ photos, set **Max Reuse** to `1`. Every tile will be a completely distinct memory.
3. **Print Resolution**: For a 24" × 36" poster at 300 DPI, export with `--width 7200` or choose `4×` scaling in the GUI export sheet.
4. **Adaptive Sensitivity**:
   - For bold subjects with stark skies: Use **Whole Canvas Quadtree** with `Sensitivity: 15%–20%` and `Min Tile: 8px`.
   - For intricate text or micro-patterns: Use **Julia Extrema Range** with `Sensitivity: 25%–35%`.
